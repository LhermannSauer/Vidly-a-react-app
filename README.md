# A react Project
## Developed during the Mastering React course done with CodeWithMosh

This project was done during a complete and comprehensive course of React offered by Mosh Hamedani. 
It simulates a site for renting movies that uses a Node backend and MongoDB.

Mosh always focuses on clean coding, emphasizing the importance of refactoring and the principle of SEparation of Concerns.
Therefore, the project tries to be ordered and clean, separaing rehusable components when possible, and structuring the code so it can be easily read.

The course covered from basic concepts to more advanced features, and used Bootstrap and third party libraries commonly used in the industry:

* Functional and class components

* Pagination, filtering and sorting
* Routing: Switch, Link, passing props, parameters, programmatic navigation, redirects
* Forms: design of rehusable input components, validation using Joi
* Calling backend Services: CRUD operations, optimistic vs pessimistic updates, handling and logging errors
* Authentication and AUthorization: storing Json web token, dynamically render components with user information, protected API endpoints
* Deployment: environment variables, production builds, deploying to Heroku
* Advance topics: higher order components, useState, useEffect and custom hooks, use of context.
